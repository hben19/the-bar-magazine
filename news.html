                        From floral touches to smoke and fog, there seems to always be a new trend in the world of booze — but some cocktails simply stand the test of time. There may be no better test of a bartender's mettle than ordering an Old Fashioned. Put sugar in glass. Cover it with dashes of bitters. Add whiskey and stir until sugar dissolves. Add ice, stir again, and serve. If the barman starts shaking the ingredients or muddling fruit, have your next round at another bar.

                        Between March and October competitors will participate in challenges designed to test the Skills that Pay the Bills and prove your competency in all aspects of what it takes to be a top bartender. Don't worry, you don't have to be a pro bartender to take part — if you love bartending, you have what it takes.

                        The world has changed a lot since the first JD Wetherspoon pub opened in 1979, but Spoons have largely stayed the same. They are a bastion of reliability. No matter where in the country, a Spoons is never too far away, ready with the welcome of beautifully cheap drinks, no-frills food and a very good carpet.
